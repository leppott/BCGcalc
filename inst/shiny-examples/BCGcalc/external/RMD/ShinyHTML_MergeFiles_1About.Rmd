# Purpose
Merge two files based on a single unique identifier column shared between the 
two files.

* File 1 (Primary)

* File 2 (Secondary)

All rows and columns in File 1 (Primary) will be carried through into the output
file. For File 2, only data for rows that match with File 1 via the common 
identifier will be carried through into the output file.

The user will select a single common identifier from each file to perform the 
merge (e.g., SampleID). The common identifier doesn’t need to be named the same 
thing in both files. Just click on the drop-down menus and the list of fields in
your input files will appear. Select the correct identifiers from each file.

In the output file, column names that overlap across the two files will have the 
suffix ‘.x’ or ‘.y’ for files 1 and 2 , respectively.

The user will have the option of viewing both input files before merging.

You can only merge two files at a time. If you want to join more, do one pair 
first, then join that file with the next file, and so on.

# Potential Applications
If you’re running the BCG calculator and are building your input file with the 
Taxa Translator/Attribute and Add Index Name/Class functions, you can use the 
Merge Files function to join those two files.  Your output file will be ready to
run through the BCG calculator.
		
You can also use the Merge Files function to join outputs from the various 
calculations (for example, the BCG model output and the thermal preference 
metrics output). Then you can examine whether changes in BCG levels are 
associated with changes in thermal indicator taxa (which could indicate thermal
alteration).
