# Purpose
Calculate thermal preference metrics, using thermal preference assignments from
Stamp et al. (in progress).  The thermal preference assignments are based on an 
analysis of  a large benthic macroinvertebrate dataset from freshwater wadeable 
streams in Oregon and Washington.

There are seven thermal preference categories:

*	Cold stenotherm

*	Cold

*	Cool

*	Cool/warm

*	Warm

*	Warm stenotherm

*	Eurythermal

Three types of metrics are included in the output: 

* number of taxa

* % taxa 

* % individuals

# Input File
There are two pathways to creating the input file:

1.	Generate a file outside of the Shiny app that is ready to go (has all the 
required fields, with exact column heading names – see the 
Calc_Metrics_Thermal_Input subtab for details).

2.	Use the File Builder ‘Taxa Translate and Attribute Assignment’ function to 
create an input file (minimum required fields = SampleID, TaxonID, Count).

The File Builder option ensures that you are using proper Operational Taxonomic
Units (OTUs) and most current thermal preference assignments for Oregon and 
Washington (Stamp et al. in progress).

# Test file
Click [here](links/Test1_ThermPrefMetric_input.csv) to download an input file that is 
ready to be run through the thermal metric calculator.

Click [here](links/BMT_MetricCalc_ThermalIndicator.R) to download the R script 
for calculating thermal preference metrics.

More metrics (beyond thermal indicators) are available in the BioMonTools R 
package. You can request the addition of new metrics to the R package or Shiny 
app by emailing Erik (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) or posting your request on the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools/discussions" target="_blank">BioMonTools GitHub discussion page</a>.
