The BCGcalc Shiny app is a free R-based tool that calculates outputs for 
Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) models (
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="_blank">US EPA 2016</a>
; Figure 1). It is linked to the 
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc" target="_blank">BCGcalc</a> 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a>  
R packages, which were developed by Erik W. Leppo (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) 
from Tetra Tech and are available on GitHub. 

This website was developed for biomonitoring programs in Oregon and Washington 
and calculates BCG model outputs for macroinvertebrate assemblages in freshwater
wadeable streams in the Pacific Northwest Maritime Region (PNMR) (Figure 2). BCG
model calibration is described in detail in Stamp 2022.  Users can also 
calculate thermal preference metrics, a biodiversity index, and more. The user 
uploads input files to the website, which will generate the outputs without the 
use of R code. Those who prefer to work with R can download the R packages from 
the GitHub sites.

functions).

## Funding 
Development of the BCGcalc and BioMonTools R packages have been funded by the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Office of Science 
and Technology (OST) (lead EPA OST scientist: Susan Jackson) and Office of 
Research and Development (ORD) (lead EPA ORD scientist: Britta Bierwagen).

The BCG was developed to serve as a scientific framework to synthesize expert knowledge with empirical observations and develop testable hypotheses on the response of aquatic biota to increasing levels of stress.](images/About_Fig2_BCG.jpg)
